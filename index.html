        <p>My name is Meera Malhotra, I'm a senior at Boston University. I am an incoming software engineer at Red Hat Research, and I interned there last summer. 
        This website serves as a portfolio where you can explore my work history, education history, project portfolio, and learn more about me.
        As for my work history, I have experience in systems research, DevOps, and cloud technologies. Outside of my work,
        I also love playing machine learning techniques in financial contexts. You can check that out in my projects!</p>
