        <p>My name is Meera Malhotra, I'm a computer science senior at Boston University. Post-graduation, I am joining Red Hat as software engineer in their research department, and where I interned last summer. 
          This website serves as a portfolio where you can explore my work experience, education history, project portfolio, and learn more about me.
          As for my work history, I have experience in systems research, DevOps, and cloud technologies. Outside of my work,
          I also love playing machine learning techniques in financial contexts. You can check that out in my projects! In my free time, I love to travel, hike, cook, and read.</p>
