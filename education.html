  <h2>Boston University</h2>
  <h3>Computer Science B.A.</h3>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>During my time at Boston University (BU), I completed my Bachelor Of Arts degree (BA)
    in computer science, with a concentration on systems. This entailed taking courwork like
    Embedded Systems, Distributed Systems, Computer Architecture, and Database Systems. I also took courswork
    pertaining to data science, like Linear Algebra, and Foundations of Data Science. During this time,
    I did research in systems, looking at CPU efficiencies, and exploring hardware versus software solutions. This work
    lead to the creation of educational content, focusing on how basic circuits work for elementary school age children.
    Along with courswork, I was involved in a lot of campus activites like Hack4Impact, an undergraduate club that creates software for
    charities, as well as participating in and speaking on panels for Girls Who Code!

  <h2>Georgetown Data Science Summer Program</h2>
  <h3>Summer Program</h3>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><p>
      During high school, I completed a month-long summer program at Georgetown focused on Data Science.
      We used public APIs to retrieve data on different climate events and to create statistics and visualizations about these events.
      We also listened to public speakers talk about how AI had applications to public policy, and were introduced to basic programming languages
      like HTML, CSS, and R.
