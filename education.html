                    <td><p id=bu> During my time at Boston University (BU), I completed my Bachelor Of Arts degree (BA)
                        in computer science, with a concentration on systems. This entailed taking courwork like
                        Embedded Systems, Distributed Systems, Computer Architecture, and Database Systems. I also took
                        courswork
                        pertaining to data science, like Linear Algebra, and Foundations of Data Science. During this
                        time,
                        I did research in systems, looking at CPU efficiencies, and exploring hardware versus software
                        solutions. This work
                        lead to the creation of educational content, focusing on how basic circuits work for elementary
                        school age children.
                        Along with courswork, I was involved in a lot of campus activites like Hack4Impact, an
                        undergraduate club that creates software for
                        charities, as well as participating in and speaking on panels for Girls Who Code!

            <h3>High School Diploma</h3>
            <p>
                I recieved my high school diploma from Chatham High School. During this time I recieved two scholarships
                for further education, the 1st Annual Tessa Handerhan Memorial Inclusion Scholarship and the Democratic
                Scholarship Committee.
                I participated in after school activities like FIRST Robotics, Academic Team, Model United Nations, and
                the Lingusitics Club.
                I also recieved the Bell Award for excellence and commitment to the social sciences. I took AP and
                honors courses in Statistics, Environmental Science,
                Art History, French, American and World History, Algebra, Geometry, and Precalculus. Along with my high
                school coursework, I took college courses in Calculus,
                Japanese, and Macro and Micro Economics.

                        During high school, I completed a month-long summer program at Georgetown focused on Data
                        Science.
                        We used public APIs to retrieve data on different climate events and to create statistics and
                        visualizations about these events.
                        We also listened to public speakers talk about how AI had applications to public policy, and
                        were introduced to basic programming languages
                        like HTML, CSS, and R.
